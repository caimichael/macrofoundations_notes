This is the github page for all of the code corresponding to Professor Backus's course notes found at [homepage](https://sites.google.com/site/nyusternmacrofoundations/home/ "Macrofoundations"). 

The original code on Professor Backus's page is written in Matlab.
Michael Cai (myself) and Mike St. Antoine have re-written these notes in Python and stored them in Jupyter Notebooks for accesibility. 

Enjoy!
